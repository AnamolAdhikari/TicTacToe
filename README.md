# Overview

This is a basic Tic Tac Toe game/program written in Kotlin using Android Studio. <br>
<br>The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the possibility of dedication and utilization of resources by using Android Studio and Kotlin integrated together. <br>
<br>By understanding and implementing the knowledge of the language it was a possibility to turn one of my favorite game into an app. <br>
